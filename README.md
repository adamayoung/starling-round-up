# Starling Bank - Technical Challenge

We’d like you to develop a "round-up" feature for Starling customers using our
public developer API that is available to all customers and partners.

For a customer, take all the transactions in a given week and round them up to
the nearest pound. For example with spending of £4.35, £5.20 and £0.87, the
round-up would be £1.58. This amount should then be transferred into a savings
goal, helping the customer save for future adventures.

## What to Build

Simple iOS application written in Swift and using UIKit. It should display the
amount to round up for a week of transactions with a way to perform the
transfer into a saving goal.
